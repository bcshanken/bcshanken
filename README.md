![Jason's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=bcshanken&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

Software engineer with a proven ability to effectively communicate with clients, team members, and department heads to ensure a quality product is delivered and satisfies all desired requirements. Prior to transitioning to coding, I was motivated as a marketing operations manager to identify deficient areas and expand capabilities accordingly - I initiated online technical document gates, online forms for virtual training, and monthly activity reports, and I bring that same level of motivation into my coding. As a life-long learner and to pursue a passion for coding, I attended a 1,000+ hour Full-Stack bootcamp to learn new skills (e.g. ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, etc.) while also sharpening existing skills. I am eager to apply my skills and passion in the software engineering industry by joining a talented development team to deliver meaningful and innovative applications.
